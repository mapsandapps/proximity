Mollie Taylor grew up in the woods, but moved to Atlanta to go to college. She didn't have a car at college but was instead dependent on her own legs and Atlanta's meager public transportation system to get around. Coming from the woods, she sometimes wanted to get out of the city to explore nature. After carefully perusing some maps and a lot of trial and error, she realized that nature is much closer than most Atlantans realize.<br><br>Mollie is a grad student at the Georgia Institute of Technology where she studies how inventors collaborate across geographical space.
